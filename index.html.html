            The sales team at "Innovate Solutions," a technology consulting firm, was on the verge of submitting a crucial bid for a multi-million dollar project with a new, high-profile client. The deadline for submission was 5:00 PM on a Friday. The team had been working tirelessly for weeks, and the final proposal document was a collaborative effort involving inputs from sales, technical, and finance teams. At 4:30 PM, the final version was ready. The Sales Lead, Mark, attempted to upload the document to the client's procurement portal, but he encountered a persistent "Upload Failed: File Size Exceeds Limit" error. Panic set in as he and his team scrambled to compress the file, but every attempt resulted in a loss of image quality, making the proposal look unprofessional. By the time they found a viable solution to reduce the file size without compromising quality, it was 5:15 PM. The submission portal had closed automatically at the deadline. The bid was missed.

        <!-- Narration for 5 Whys Technique -->
        <div class="narration">
            <h3>Understanding the "5 Whys" Technique</h3>
            <p>The "5 Whys" is a simple yet powerful root cause analysis technique used to explore the underlying reasons behind a problem. By repeatedly asking "Why?"—typically five times—you can peel away the layers of symptoms and uncover the true root cause of an issue. This method is widely used in Lean, Six Sigma, and quality improvement processes to ensure that corrective actions address the real problem, not just its symptoms.</p>
            <p>In the following questions, we’ll apply the 5 Whys technique to the missed bid submission scenario. Your goal is to trace the issue back to its root cause by selecting the most accurate answer for each "Why."</p>

        <!-- 5 Whys questions -->
        <div class="question">
            <p>8. Why did we miss the submission deadline?</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q8" value="A"> A. Because the proposal file was too large to upload to the client's portal.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q8" value="B"> B. Because we were on vacation.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q8" value="C"> C. Because the computer broke.<br>

            <p>9. Why was the file too large?</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q9" value="A"> A. Because the file size limit was low.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q9" value="B"> B. Because it contained numerous high-resolution images and embedded graphics that were not optimized for size.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q9" value="C"> C. Because the team didn't know how to compress files.<br>

            <p>12. Why were the technical requirements overlooked?</p>
